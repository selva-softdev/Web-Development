<h2>Variable</h2>
    <p>Creating a variable in JavaScript is called "declaring" a variable.</p>
    <p>Variables are Containers for Storing Data</p>
    <p>variables must be identified with unique names.    
        These unique names are called identifiers.
        After the declaration, the variable has no value (technically it is undefined).
        You can declare many variables in one statement.
    </p>
    <p>
        The general rules for declaring names for variables (unique identifiers) are:

            Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
            Names must begin with a letter.
            Names can also begin with $ and _
            Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables).
            Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names.
            Variables declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block:
            Variables declared with the var always have Global Scope.
    </p>
    <p>
        JavaScript Variables can be declared in 4 ways:<br>
        Automatically<br>
        Using var<br>
        Using let<br>
        Using const
    </p>
    Always use const if the value should not be changed
    let and const cannot be Redeclared, var can be redeclared.
    <p>

    </p>
    <h3>Example:</h3>
    number1;<br>
    var number1<br>
    let number1<br>
    const number1=5<br>
    let person = "John Doe", carName = "Volvo", price = 200;

    <h3>Const</h3>
    <p>Because of this you can NOT:

        Reassign a constant value
        Reassign a constant array
        Reassign a constant object
        But you CAN:
        
        Change the elements of constant array
        Change the properties of constant object</p>

        Constant Arrays:
        -----------------
        // You can create a constant array:
        const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];

        // You can change an element:
        cars[0] = "Toyota";

        // You can add an element:
        cars.push("Audi");

        Constant Objects
        -----------------
        // You can create a const object:
        const car = {type:"Fiat", model:"500", color:"white"};

        // You can change a property:
        car.color = "red";

        // You can add a property:
        car.owner = "Johnson";


        <h2>Assignment Operator</h2>
        <p>In JavaScript, the equal sign (=) is an "assignment" operator, not an "equal to" operator.</p>


        <h2>Datatypes</h2>
        <p>JavaScript has 8 Datatypes:
            1. String
            2. Number
            3. Bigint
            4. Boolean
            5. Undefined
            6. Null
            7. Symbol
            8. Object
            
            The Object Datatype:
            1. An object
            2. An array
            3. A date</p>

            // Numbers:
            let length = 16;
            let weight = 7.5;

            // Strings:
            let color = "Yellow";
            let lastName = "Johnson";

            // Booleans
            let x = true;
            let y = false;

            // Object:
            const person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe"};

            // Array object:
            const cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];

            // Date object:
            const date = new Date("2022-03-25");

            <h2>typeof() operator:</h2>
            <p>The typeof operator returns the type of a variable or an expression</p>
            typeof "John Doe"     // Returns "string"
            typeof 314            // Returns "number"


            <h2>Operators</h2>
                The numbers (in an arithmetic operation) are called operands.
                The operation (to be performed between the two operands) is defined by an operator.
            <h3>Aritmetic operator</h3>

            JavaScript Assignment Operators
            Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables.

            Operator	Example	Same As
            =	x = y	x = y
            +=	x += y	x = x + y
            -=	x -= y	x = x - y
            *=	x *= y	x = x * y
            /=	x /= y	x = x / y
            %=	x %= y	x = x % y
            **=	x **= y	x = x ** y

            Shift Assignment Operators
            Operator	Example	Same As
            <<=	x <<= y	x = x << y
            >>=	x >>= y	x = x >> y
            >>>=	x >>>= y	x = x >>> y

            Bitwise Assignment Operators
            Operator	Example	Same As
            &=	x &= y	x = x & y
            ^=	x ^= y	x = x ^ y
            |=	x |= y	x = x | y
            
            Logical Assignment Operators
            Operator	Example	Same As
            &&=	x &&= y	x = x && (x = y)
            ||=	x ||= y	x = x || (x = y)
            ??=	x ??= y	x = x ?? (x = y)
